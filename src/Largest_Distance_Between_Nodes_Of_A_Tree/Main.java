/**
 * Original problem: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/largest-distance-between-nodes-of-a-tree/
 *
 * Find largest distance
 * Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes. The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree. Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes (there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree). The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.
 *
 * The tree is given as an array P, there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N). Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.
 *
 *  Example:
 * If given P is [-1, 0, 0, 0, 3], then node 0 is the root and the whole tree looks like this:
 *           0
 *        /  |  \
 *       1   2   3
 *                \
 *                 4
 *  One of the longest path is 1 -> 0 -> 3 -> 4 and its length is 3, thus the answer is 3. Note that there are other paths with maximal distance.
