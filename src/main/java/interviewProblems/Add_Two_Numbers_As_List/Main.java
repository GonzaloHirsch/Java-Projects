/**
 * Original problem: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/add-two-numbers-as-lists/
 *
 * You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 *
 * Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 * Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 *
 *     342 + 465 = 807
 * Make sure there are no trailing zeros in the output list
 * So, 7 -> 0 -> 8 -> 0 is not a valid response even though the value is still 807.
