/**
 * Original problem: EXAMPLE QUESTION FROM HACKER RANK ON YELP CODING CHALLENGE
 *
 * Business owners would like to know about how their yelp reviews are going, so we aggregate those stats for them.
 * Given a list of reviews, find the most recent review, the earliest review, a count of total number of reviews, and the average rating rounded to the nearest 0.5.
 * A review looks like:
 * {
 * "review_id: 1 // an integer id of a the review
 * "date": Â«2021-01-26" // the date the review was created
 * "rating: 5 // an integer between 1 and 5
 * }
 * The expected return value will be a ReviewStats object which contains
 * most_recent_review_date: string least recent_ review_date: string review count: integer average_rating: float
