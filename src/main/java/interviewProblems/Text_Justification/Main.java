/**
 * Original problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/
 *
 * Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 *
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
 *
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
 *
 * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
 * Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
 * The input array words contains at least one word.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 *    "This    is    an",
 *    "example  of text",
 *    "justification.  "
 * ]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
 * Output:
 * [
 *   "What   must   be",
 *   "acknowledgment  ",
 *   "shall be        "
 * ]
 * Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
 * Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
 * Output:
 * [
 *   "Science  is  what we",
 *   "understand      well",
 *   "enough to explain to",
 *   "a  computer.  Art is",
 *   "everything  else  we",
 *   "do                  "
 * ]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= words.length <= 300
 * 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
 * words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
 * 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
 * words[i].length <= maxWidth
