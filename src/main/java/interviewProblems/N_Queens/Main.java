/**
 * Original problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/
 *
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 *
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
 * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: [["Q"]]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 9
